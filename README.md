# Matthew's Text Editor PWA

I created my first Progressive Web App (PWA) by implementing methods to get and store data in an IndexedDB database for an existing application. The majority of my work involved modifying the JavaScript files in the 'src' folder to accept and retrieve data from IndexedDB.

Throughout the process, I familiarized myself with page inspections and used the console to verify registered service workers and saved data. This project was an excellent opportunity to explore a tool that is becoming increasingly popular among brands.

In accordance with the Challenge Acceptance Criteria, my PWA successfully achieved the following:

✨ Upon opening the application in the editor, a client server folder structure appeared.

✨ The backend could be started and the client served by running npm run start.

✨ JavaScript files were bundled using webpack.

✨ Running webpack plugins generated an HTML file, service worker, and manifest file.

✨ The text editor functioned smoothly in the browser without errors, using next-gen JavaScript.

✨ IndexedDB immediately created a database storage upon opening the text editor.

✨ Content in the text editor was successfully saved with IndexedDB after being entered and subsequently clicking off the DOM window.

✨ The content in the text editor was successfully retrieved from IndexedDB after reopening.

✨ Clicking on the Install button allowed the web application to be downloaded as an icon on the desktop.

✨ A registered service worker appeared with workbox after loading the web app.

✨ Static assets were pre-cached upon loading, along with subsequent pages and static assets after registering as a service worker.

✨ Proper build scripts for a webpack application appeared after deploying to Heroku.
